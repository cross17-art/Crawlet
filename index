Implement a web-cravler that crawls websites with a given depth
links (default 8) and maximum traffic limit
pages (10,000 by default). Crabler starts with a pre-defined URL and follows those found
links to dive deeper. The main purpose of this crawler is to detect the presence of certain terms on a page and collect statistics.
